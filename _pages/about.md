I am a <strong>research scientist at <a href="http://www.imarpe.gob.pe/">Marine Institute of the Sea</a></strong> in the field of  <strong>Data Sciences and Marine Biology </strong>. I am quite involved in interdisciplinary research at the interface between data science and marine ecology. My current research interests include deep and machine learning applications to understanding marine resources.
