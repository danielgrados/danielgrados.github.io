I am a research scientist at Marine Institute of the Sea - <strong>IMARPE in the field of Data Science and Marine Biology. I am quite involved in interdisciplinary research at the interface between data science and marine ecology. My current research interests include deep and machine learning applications to understanding marine resources.
